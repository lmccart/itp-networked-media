ITP Networked Media
===================

__Repository for ITP Comm Lab: Networked Media, Fall 2014__

The network is one of our most fundamental mediums for interactivity. It makes possible our interaction with machines, data, and, most importantly, other people. Though the base interaction it supports is simple, a client sends a request to a server, which replies; an incredible variety of systems can be and have been built on top of it. In this course, students will utilize JavaScript as both a client and server side programming language to build creative network systems. Additionally, HTML and CSS will be used to define the structure and look.

##Evaluation

Grades will be determined according to the following breakdown:
* Regular Assignments 40%
* Participation and Attendance 40%
* Final Project 20%

Please see ITP's statement on [Pass/Fail](http://help.itp.nyu.edu/academic-policies/pass-fail) which states that a "Pass" is equivalent to an "A" or a "B" while anything less would be considered a "Fail".

We will have weekly assignments that are relevant to material from the previous class. These assignments are required and you should be prepared to show/talk about them in class. It is expected that everyone in the class will create and maintain a blog for their assignments.

Attendance is mandatory. Please inform your teacher via email if you are going to miss a class. Habitually showing up late for class or an excessive number of absences will adversely affect your grade.

This class will be participatory, you are expected to participate in discussions and give feedback to other students both in class and participate with their projects. This (along with attendance) is 40% of your grade.

Class will culminate final projects. You are expected to push your abilities to produce something that utilizes what you have learned in the class that is useful in some manner to yourself or the world. This will comprise 20% of your grade.

For step-by-step tutorials, we have access to Lynda.com training courses via the NYU Library. If you're new to HTML and/or CSS, I highly recommend watching these.

Request a Lynda.com account at http://nyu.libguides.com/digitalstudio/appointments (It’s in the "Make an Appointment" form, but you don’t actually make an appointment.) On the form, check "Instructional Video Modules". It may take a day or two to get approved.
